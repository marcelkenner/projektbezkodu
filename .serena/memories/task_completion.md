# Task Completion Checklist

1. Ensure files adhere to size/OOP constraints from `AGENTS.md` and follow mobile-first styling.
2. Run relevant validation commands (`npm run lint`, forthcoming `npm run tokens:build`, etc.) when code changes touch frontend or tokens.
3. Update accompanying documentation (e.g., `docs/brand_design_system_plan.md`, changelog entries) to reflect changes.
4. Verify assets/tokens reside under `/brand/` with correct naming and update `brand/CHANGELOG.md` when brand elements change.
5. Summarise changes for the user, referencing file paths and suggesting next actions or tests.
