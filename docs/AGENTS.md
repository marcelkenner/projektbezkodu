# Agent Guidance – `docs/`

- Documentation should be concise, actionable, and under 200 lines per file. Use headings + checklists where helpful.
- Cross-link related docs (e.g., reference plans from the index) and update the relevant plan when new work is documented.
- Use present tense and keep instructions self-contained so newcomers can follow them without context.
- When adding new plans, register them in `docs/brand/index.md` or other relevant indices.
- Avoid duplicating copy; instead reference the authoritative plan or spec.
