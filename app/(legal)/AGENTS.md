# Agent Guidance – `app/(legal)`

- Legal pages hold placeholder text until final legal copy arrives. Store the authoritative copy in markdown or external source, then import/render here.
- Keep sections short with clear headings and ensure accessibility (semantic headings, lists).
- Once real copy is available, coordinate with stakeholders and update `data/copy/privacy.json` / `terms.json` for lead paragraphs.
- Avoid duplicating legal text across files; use shared helpers if multiple pages need the same notice.
