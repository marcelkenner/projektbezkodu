# Agent Guidance – `content/`

- Store all Markdown content here. Each file must include frontmatter matching the schema defined in `docs/brand/frontmatter_schema.md`.
- Keep sections short; split long guides into subdirectories. Respect 500-line max per file.
- Use lowercase, hyphenated slugs and ensure `path` fields align with generated routes.
- Do not embed HTML; rely on Markdown + MDX components when necessary.
- Whenever new frontmatter fields are required, update the schema doc and metadata mapping before adding them.
