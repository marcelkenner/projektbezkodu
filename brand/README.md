# ProjektBezKodu Brand Assets

This directory houses production-ready brand artefacts. Keep files under 500 lines; add subfolders as needed.

## Structure

- `logo/` – SVG/PNG marks and lockups.
- `icons/` – UI icons exported as optimized SVG.
- `pwa/` – PWA icons (maskable, apple-touch icons).
- `tokens/` – Generated design tokens (`tokens.css`, `tokens.json`, `tokens.ts`).
- `docs/` – Supporting documentation or specs tied directly to assets.
- `figma-exports/` – Archived `.fig` files from each release.

## Usage Guidelines

- Do not edit exported assets in place; update source design in Figma, then re-export.
- Keep filenames descriptive (`logo-lockup-horizontal.svg`) and include version if necessary.
- When adding new assets, update this README and relevant documentation in `docs/brand/`.
